# Astronomical & Numerical Analyzer (ANA)
ANA is a Python-based tool for analyzing astronomical data using numerical methods, with a focus on PERIOD analysis of Kepler and TESS stars.

# Methods
1. Lomb-Scargle Periodogram - By Astropy;
2. Time-Frequency Lomb-Scargle - By Astropy;
3. Autocorrelation - using three Libraries: Numpy, Scipy, Pandas;
4. Autocorrelation Tempogram - Using Numpy's autocorrelation method;
5. FFT
6. Wavelet - Using Ssqueezepy;
7. Box Least Square (BLS) - From Lightkurve;
8. Gaussian Process
